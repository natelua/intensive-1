                            We have 180 acres of blackberries. 
                            Our blackberries are succulent,soft and juicy. 
                            We pick blackberries 6 days a week for an average of 10 hours a day to 
                            ensure they are fresh by the time they reach the consumer.

                            We have 100 acres of raspberries. 
                            By nature raspberries are low in calories but high in fiber,vitamins,minerals and anti-oxidents.
                            We harvest raspberries at the beggining of our season in May all the way through the month of November.
